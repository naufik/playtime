# PlayTime

PlayTime is a simple to-do list application written in C#, .NET Framework 4, and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). Its primarily geared to 'stop procrastination' by preventing specified applications from launching unless all current tasks are completed.

This was submitted for my IB MYP Personal Project (2013), previously hosted on CodePlex and uploaded to GitHub on 2018. **It is now obsolete, as some APIs do not work anymore.**
